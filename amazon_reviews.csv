I liked this product because of it's versitility. I can use the stand for my cellphone or set it up under my laptop to allow air to flow and keep my unit cool
"Works good for holding cell phone, but not sturdy enough for 10"" tablet."
Very helpful when I want to use my phone for an extended period of time. Very pleased with the purchase.
It is compact and versatile.
Great versatility and holds my phone or tablet. Does exactly what I need it to. I just wish the joints were a bit sturdier so I can set it at multiple angles to hold my tablet.
"The product is perfect for me.  I use it on my desk, my tables, my kitchen counter and so easy and compact to move.  I would definitely recommend it."
I bought this to use with my phone and it worked perfectly. I ended up using it with my Ipad too and it's sturdy and works great with that too. Definitely recommend hope it works for you too :)
"It works with my iPhone, my iPad, even my Nintendo Switch. It's extremely sturdy, easy to use and is perfect for traveling since it doesn't take up a lot of space. More than worth the price!"
